// to control the View itself. However, it's not an inner enum as we might want to use
// it for other things that are expensive to do lifecycle on as a general
// enum, and it might want to be exposed to clients.
// I'm keeping it in limbo for now to avoid documenting it, and we'll
// see how it goes.
