How to use the build system
---------------------------

As usual, all this assumes that ant is already in your path.

  ant pull-or-clone

will do the initial clone of each project into the 'projects' directory.  When you run this subsequently, it does a
git pull on each project, although you will probably need to edit the build.xml file to tell the git task which 
branch you want of each project.

To publish changes to the shared repository, use:

  ant publish-all

The mount location of //readynas.hq should be O: on windows or /ogdev on Linux. If mounted elsewhere, this can be
specified as the IVY_SHARED_DEFAULT_ROOT environment variable.

ant -p will give you all the targets available and they're pretty self explainatory.

Each project's build.xml includes the common.xml file in common/ which defines most targets.  Any tasks that need
further customization can be customized by simply overriding that task (for an example, see the javadocs task in 
OG-Analytics/build.xml.

common.xml also includes common/build.properties files.
