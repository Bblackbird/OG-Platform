  <p>Provides function definitions to the dependency graph builder when a view is compiled. Function resolvers are backed
  by a function repository and can return candidate functions for calculating any requested result. A dependency graph builder
  selects functions that can produce the requested outputs, and then works recursively with the resolver to provide the
  inputs needed for these until the graph is complete or discovered to be unsatisfiable.</p>
