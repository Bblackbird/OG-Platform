/**
 * A view represents a {@link ViewDefinition} in the context of a {@link ViewProcessor}; this is everything required
 * to perform computations and create clients which listen to the output. The view is responsible for managing its own
 * computation efficiently in response to demand from its clients, and for sharing computation results among its
 * clients.
 * <p>
 * Views must be initialized by calling {@link #init()} before computations can be performed. This operation involves
 * resolving every aspect of the view definition and building the view's dependency graph, which is potentially
 * time-consuming. Initialization only takes place on the first call to {@link #init()}; therefore it should be called
 * defensively without performance considerations.
 * <p>
 * Uninitialized views may be used only to access the underlying view definition, and parts of the processing context
 * such as live data overrides. An {@link IllegalStateException} is thrown when attempting to perform an operation that
 * is unsupported on an uninitialized view.
