  <p>Defines the Live Data abstraction used by the OpenGamma engine to access market data or have values injected into a computation.</p>
  <p>Dependency graph building works with a live data availability provider to determine when a graph is fully constructed. If a value can
  be provided from live data, it will be used in the execution, otherwise it will be considered an intermediate calculated value and the
  function resolver will be consulted.</p>
